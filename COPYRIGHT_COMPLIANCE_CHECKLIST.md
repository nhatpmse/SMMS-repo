# Copyright Compliance Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your application is ready for commercial use from a copyright and licensing perspective.

## 1. Internal Code Audit

- [ ] Review all source code to identify any copied code from external sources
- [ ] Ensure all team members have signed proper IP assignment agreements
- [ ] Document all original code and functionality created by your team
- [ ] Identify any customized algorithms or unique processes for potential IP protection

## 2. Third-Party Dependencies

- [ ] Generate a complete list of all third-party libraries used in your application
      ```bash
      # For npm projects
      npm list --depth=0 > dependencies.txt
      
      # For yarn projects
      yarn list --depth=0 > dependencies.txt
      ```
- [ ] Review the license of each third-party library:
  - [ ] MIT/Apache 2.0/BSD: Generally permissive for commercial use
  - [ ] GPL/AGPL: May require open-sourcing your code if distributed
  - [ ] LGPL: Requires making library modifications available, but can link to proprietary code
  - [ ] Commercial: Check if you have proper licenses for commercial deployment
- [ ] Update THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md with all third-party licenses
- [ ] Remove or replace any dependencies with incompatible licenses

## 3. UI/UX Assets
