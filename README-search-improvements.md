# Search Functionality Improvements

This update enhances the search functionality for students and brosis in the StudentView component with the following features:

## New Features

### For Student Search
1. **Debounced Search**: Prevents excessive API calls while typing by waiting until user stops typing
2. **Search Suggestions**: Shows matching students as you type
3. **Recent Searches**: Tracks and displays your recent searches for quick access
4. **Clear Button**: One-click clearing of the search field
5. **Visual Enhancements**: Improved UI with search icon and loading indicators
6. **Keyboard Navigation**: Better focus handling for improved accessibility
7. **Vietnamese Support**: Maintains support for Vietnamese diacritics

### For Brosis Filter
1. **Improved UI**: Consistent with student search field
2. **Clear Button**: Easy clearing of the brosis filter
3. **Visual Feedback**: Icon indicates brosis-specific search

## Technical Implementation

- Uses React `useRef` for proper dropdown positioning
- Implements `useCallback` and `debounce` for performance optimization
- Stores recent searches in `localStorage` for persistence
- Automatically closes dropdowns when clicking outside (click-outside detection)
- Shows loading state while fetching suggestions

## Usage

1. **Basic Search**: Just start typing in either search box
2. **Using Suggestions**: Click on a suggestion to select it
3. **Using Recent Searches**: Click on a recent search to use it again
4. **Clearing Search**: Click the X button or clear the field manually

## Future Improvements

- Add API-based suggestions for brosis search
- Implement keyboard navigation through suggestions
- Add categorized suggestions (by ID/name/email)
- Implement search history management (clear history, pin favorites)
