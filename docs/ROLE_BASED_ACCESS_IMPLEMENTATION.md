# Role-Based Access Control Implementation in School Management System

## Overview
We've successfully implemented role-based access control in the school management system with the following roles:
- **Root**: The highest level administrator (only one allowed in the system)
- **Admin**: Administrator with high-level permissions
- **Mentor**: Mid-level role with specialized permissions
- **BroSis**: Regular user role (default)

## Changes Made

### Database Schema
1. Added the `role` field to the User model with possible values: 'root', 'admin', 'mentor', 'brosis'
2. Updated the database migration scripts to include the role field
3. Maintained backward compatibility with existing `is_root` and `is_admin` flags
4. Ensured the update_schema.py script correctly sets roles based on existing flags

### Backend Services
1. Modified user.py to enforce that only one root user can exist in the system
2. Updated authentication logic to use the role field for permissions
3. Changed all API endpoints to use role-based permission checks
4. Ensured 2FA is required for root users

### Frontend
1. Updated UserManagement component to display and manage the new roles
2. Modified the User interface type definition to use the new role options
3. Ensured the Sidebar component shows appropriate navigation items based on roles
4. Updated SetupInfo access control to only allow root users

## Testing
1. Verified that only one root user can exist in the system
2. Tested creation of users with different roles (admin, mentor, brosis)
3. Confirmed that role-based permissions are correctly enforced in the API
4. Updated existing users to have the correct role values

## Next Steps
1. Implement more specific permissions for each role in various features
2. Add role-specific dashboards or components as needed
3. Consider adding an audit log viewer for administrators to track changes
4. Add role descriptions in the user interface for clarity

## Technical Debt Addressed
1. Eliminated the redundancy between `is_root`/`is_admin` flags and the `role` field
2. Ensured consistent role-based permissions across all endpoints
3. Improved code maintainability by centralizing role checking
